# hutao (Hu Tao Package Manager (ALPHA))
Pretty simple way how to manage your packages and install them or remove them
## Why Hu Tao?
Well, deciding a name on a package manager isn't that easy. Since I also wanted to join in the Debian naming trend. So I named it Hu Tao, named after my beloved waifu form Genshin Impact.
